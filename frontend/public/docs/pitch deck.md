Nice — below is a ready-to-use pitch deck outline for **Quere (Queue) Management System** formatted exactly as you asked: **The Problem → The Need → Our Solution → Why Now → The Market (facts & stats) → Competitors (global + Nigeria) → Point(s) of Differentiation → Business Model → How to Scale**.

I included short speaker notes for each slide so you can paste into slides or present directly. I also cited the key market and competitor facts (most load-bearing claims) so your numbers are backed by sources.

---

# Slide 1 — Title

**Quere — Modern Queue Management System**
One line: Replace physical lines with smart, real-time virtual queues — save time, reduce crowding, improve operations.

---

# Slide 2 — The Problem

* People waste hours waiting in physical lines at banks, hospitals, government offices, universities and retail.
* Long wait times cause stress, lost revenue (abandoned customers), crowded lobbies and poor customer experience.
  Speaker note: Give a quick example — bank queues on salary days, long lines at university registration.

---

# Slide 3 — The Need

* Customers need a way to join and monitor queues remotely and only show up when it’s their turn.
* Organizations need predictable throughput, reduced no-shows, real-time visibility and analytics to optimize staff.
  Speaker note: Emphasize both sides: user convenience + operational efficiency.

---

# Slide 4 — Our Solution

* **Quere** — web + mobile-friendly virtual queuing platform with: join-from-anywhere, real-time position tracking, multi-mode absent-customer handling (strict / grace / flexible), staff dashboard, SMS/push alerts, QR/location join, and analytics.
* Org-configurable rules (grace time, missed-turn policy), multi-branch support and easy integrations (SMS providers, kiosks).
  Speaker note: Mention hybrid absent-customer modes as a unique configurable feature.

---

# Slide 5 — Why Now

* Post-pandemic priorities (reduced crowding) + digital-first expectations + smartphone penetration make virtual queuing urgent.
* Organizations are investing in experience & efficiency tools (appointment + queue tech).
  Speaker note: Short and urgent — behavior and investment trends favor this product now.

---

# Slide 6 — The Market (facts & stats)

* The global queue management system market is sizeable and growing: one estimate puts the market at **~USD 794M in 2023** with projected growth to **~USD 1.22B by 2030** (CAGR ~6.4%). ([Grand View Research][1])
* Other analysts estimate the market in the **USD hundreds of millions (e.g., ~USD 598M–1B range depending on source and year)** and forecast steady mid-single-digit CAGR through the decade. ([IMARC Group][2])
* Demand drivers: healthcare (reduce contagion & optimize flows), banking/retail (reduce lost sales to long lines), government services (improve citizen experience). ([IMARC Group][2])
  Speaker note: Use “market size ~USD 0.6–1.2B today, growing at ~4–6% CAGR” when talking to investors — show the range and cite sources.

---

# Slide 7 — Competitors — Global

* **Qmatic** — established global leader (manages billions of customer journeys annually; enterprise deployments across finance, healthcare, public sector). ([qmatic.com][3])
* **QLess** — cloud-native mobile queuing pioneer with broad adoption across government, healthcare, education; large installation base and analytics features. ([Wikipedia][4])
* **Other players / regional providers** — Waitwhile, Qudini, local integrators and AV/IT integrators offering kiosk + signage + QMS bundles.
  Speaker note: Acknowledge big incumbents; position Quere as nimbler and better suited to local needs.

---

# Slide 8 — Competitors — Nigeria / Local Providers

* **Q-SYS** (Q-SYS Nigeria / regional integrators) — local queue management and CX solutions offering kiosks, virtual queue and appointment booking. ([Q-SYS][5])
* Local system integrators and AV firms (examples: Mentorworld, Mitobi, Kecam Technologies) deliver tailored QMS solutions for banks, hospitals and government. ([Mentorworld Synergy Ltd][6])
  Speaker note: Stress that local vendors exist but many are heavy on hardware and customization — opportunity for SaaS with local-first UX and flexible pricing.

---

# Slide 9 — Points of Differentiation (Why Quere wins)

1. **Configurable absent-customer policies** (strict / grace / flexible) per organization or per queue — proven to reduce friction and balance fairness vs throughput.
2. **SaaS-first + lightweight kiosk integration** — lower hardware dependency than many integrators; faster deployments.
3. **Local focus + payments & SMS integrations for Nigeria** (Africa’s Talking / local SMS gateways, local payments for bookings).
4. **Role-based staff UX + simple admin toggles** so non-technical staff control behavior without vendor involvement.
5. **Modular revenue streams** (SaaS subscription + per-notification fees + enterprise customization).
   Speaker note: Tie each point to customer pain (cost, speed, control).

---

# Slide 10 — Business Model

* **SaaS subscription** — tiered plans (Starter for single location, Growth for multi-location, Enterprise for large orgs).
* **Usage fees** — SMS / Notification credits and optional kiosk hardware sales or leasing.
* **Professional services** — onboarding, custom integrations, SLAs.
* **Revenue example:** low-touch customer could join at $49/mo per location; enterprise deals with volume pricing and implementation fees.
  Speaker note: Highlight predictable recurring revenue + upsell paths (analytics, premium SLAs).

---

# Slide 11 — Go-to-Market & How to Scale

1. **Phase 1 (Product-market fit)** — target banks + clinics + universities in major Nigerian cities; pilot 5–10 locations with a paid pilot (3 months).
2. **Phase 2 (Channel & Partnerships)** — partner with local IT integrators, kiosk vendors, and government service centers; integrate with popular SMS providers and payment gateways.
3. **Phase 3 (Scale & Enterprise)** — hire enterprise sales for banks and government tenders; expand to West Africa; build multi-branch management and advanced analytics.
4. **Marketing playbook** — case studies (time saved, drop in abandonment), local conferences, targeted sales to CX heads, and direct outreach to government procurement.
5. **Product scaling** — multi-region hosting, offline-first kiosks for poor connectivity, API for large integrators.
   Speaker note: Emphasize quick pilot -> replicate model via channel partners; leverage local knowledge and low-cost SMS integrations.

---

# Slide 12 — Traction / Pilot Plan (what investors want to see)

* Run 3 pilots (bank branch, clinic, university admissions center) in months 1–3.
* Measure: average wait time reduction, % of customers who skip physical lines, staff efficiency gains, abandoned-customer reduction.
* Convert 1–2 pilots into paid customers and use results as sales proof.
  Speaker note: Keep metrics measurable: target 30–50% reduction in physical queue occupancy for pilot sites.

---

# Slide 13 — Ask / Use of Funds

* Product completion (features: admin dashboard, absent-customer modes, SMS gateway integration)
* 3 pilot deployments, local sales hires, marketing and legal/compliance.
* Typical early-stage ask example: $150k–$350k to reach enterprise-ready product + initial sales traction (adjust to your plan).
  Speaker note: Customize numbers later to match your actual funding needs.

---

# Slide 14 — Closing — Why Quere?

* Real problem, proven demand, addressable market in the **hundreds of millions to over a billion USD** globally. ([Grand View Research][1])
* Local-first approach, flexible absent-customer policies, and low-hardware SaaS model give Quere a strong route to traction in Nigeria and beyond.
  Speaker note: End with a one-liner: “Quere: time back for customers, predictability for organizations.”

If you want, I can next:

1. Turn each slide into 1–2 PowerPoint slides with speaker notes and visuals (I can create a PPTX).
2. Create a 1-page investor one-pager / executive summary.
3. Draft cold outreach messages / email templates for pilots (banks, clinics, universities).

Which of those should I build next?
